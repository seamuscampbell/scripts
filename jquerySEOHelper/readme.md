jQuery script to set all element id and name attribites to each other and all image alt and titles to each other.

Since forms only read the name of the element and not the id, this could be helpful since it makes each each element's name its id and its id the name. Also, unless you have it set in your browser settings, the tooltip doesn't show up when you just have the alt attribute set.
